Citizen Science - Machine learning to understand ant behaviour in the zoo

The Evolutionary Biomechanics Group at Imperial College London led by Dr David Labonte is currently working to automate behavioural analyses on ants, specifically leaf cutter ants (genus Atta), to study emergence and swarm intelligence in eusocial insects. Individually, ants are unable to perform complex tasks and are likely to die. However, in a colony, ants are able to delegate tasks, communicate with each other, and forage for food. The research aims to answer the question of how ants are able to display such behaviours in a colony, and to use the results to build a model which can be studied and then applied to systems such as traffic handling and route planning. In order to achieve this, the research is broken down into two main parts. The first part involves tracking the position of individual ants, and the second part involves task recognition. This project focuses on the first part of the research - tracking individual antsâ€™ positions.

Machine learning and computer vision tools play a huge role in ant behaviour research, however, large training datasets are required. Collection of labelled data can be difficult because of the sheer number of ants, and the complexity of behaviours displayed. Thus, there is a need to develop an application that will be used for labelled data collection, which should be easily used and understood by the general public. The UI will be used in a zoo in Zurich as part of a Citizen Science project, in order to collect more data efficiently and quickly to train the machine learning algorithms.
